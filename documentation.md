# Password Cracking Script Documentation

## Introduction
This password cracking script demonstrates basic password cracking techniques such as brute-forcing and dictionary attacks. It is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. The script attempts to crack an encrypted password by generating all possible combinations of characters and comparing them to the encrypted password.

## Usage
To use the password cracking script, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the script from the GitHub repository.
3. Open the script in your preferred Python editor or IDE.
4. Modify the `encrypted_password` variable to the target password's encrypted form.
5. Run the script.

## Functionality
The script utilizes a brute-force attack to crack the password. It iteratively generates all possible combinations of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. The script checks each generated combination against the encrypted password until a match is found or all combinations are exhausted.

## Requirements
The password cracking script has the following requirements:

- Python 3.x or higher

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the password cracking script:

```python
import itertools
import string

def brute_force_attack(password):
    # Code implementation

# Usage Example
encrypted_password = "2b4e8c9a16b2f4d6"
password, attempts = brute_force_attack(encrypted_password)

if password is not None:
    print(f"Password found: {password}")
    print(f"Total attempts: {attempts}")
else:
    print("Password not found.")
```

## Security Considerations
It is crucial to note that password cracking activities can be illegal and unethical if performed without proper authorization or consent. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before attempting password cracking techniques. Additionally, this script is a basic demonstration and may not be suitable for cracking complex passwords. Use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.

## Conclusion
The password cracking script provides a basic demonstration of brute-force attack techniques. It is intended for educational purposes, promoting ethical hacking practices, and raising awareness about the importance of strong passwords. Remember to always use this knowledge responsibly and respect the legal and ethical boundaries.
